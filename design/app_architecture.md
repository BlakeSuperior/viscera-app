# VISCERA Mobile App Architecture

## Overview
VISCERA is a psychological simulator that presents users with moral dilemmas and ethical simulations, analyzes their responses, and builds an evolving profile of their psyche. The application consists of four key systems working in concert to deliver an immersive, introspective experience.

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Systems

#### 1.1 The Chamber (Frontend)
- **Purpose**: Delivers interactive narrative experiences and captures user responses
- **Components**:
  - Simulation Renderer: Displays narrative text with appropriate styling and pacing
  - Response Interface: Captures natural language input from users
  - Command Parser: Recognizes special commands (e.g., "End Simulation")
  - State Manager: Tracks current simulation state and user progression
  - Narrative Engine: Controls flow and branching of simulations

#### 1.2 The Profiler Engine (Backend)
- **Purpose**: Analyzes user responses and builds psychological profiles
- **Components**:
  - LLM Integration: Connects to AI models (ChatGPT, Claude, or local LLM)
  - Response Analyzer: Processes natural language responses
  - Pattern Recognition: Identifies recurring themes and behaviors
  - Contradiction Detector: Flags inconsistencies between stated beliefs and actions
  - Profile Builder: Constructs and updates user's psychological profile
  - Analysis Generator: Creates post-simulation breakdowns

#### 1.3 The Library (Data Storage)
- **Purpose**: Archives all completed simulations and analyses
- **Components**:
  - Simulation Repository: Stores simulation templates and scenarios
  - User History: Records all completed simulations and responses
  - Analysis Archive: Stores all generated analyses
  - Tagging System: Categorizes simulations by theme, outcome, etc.
  - Search Engine: Allows retrieval by various parameters

#### 1.4 The Construct (Visualization)
- **Purpose**: Visualizes the user's evolving psychological profile
- **Components**:
  - Trait Visualizer: Displays psychological traits using various charts
  - Contradiction Mapper: Shows inconsistencies and internal conflicts
  - Timeline Tracker: Visualizes changes in profile over time
  - Narrative Role Identifier: Shows patterns in assumed roles

### 2. Technical Architecture

#### 2.1 Frontend
- **Framework**: React Native (for cross-platform compatibility)
- **State Management**: Redux for global state, Context API for component-specific state
- **UI Components**: Custom components adhering to the dark cathedral aesthetic
- **Animation**: React Native Animated API for smooth transitions and effects
- **Text Rendering**: Custom text renderer for typography effects

#### 2.2 Backend
- **API Layer**: RESTful API for communication with LLM services
- **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication for user sessions
- **Data Processing**: Node.js for server-side processing
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API or equivalent for LLM capabilities

#### 2.3 Database
- **User Data**: NoSQL database (MongoDB) for flexible schema
- **Simulation Templates**: JSON-based storage for narrative structures
- **Profile Data**: Document-based storage for evolving user profiles
- **Media Assets**: CDN or local storage for audio and visual elements

#### 2.4 Offline Capabilities
- **Local Storage**: IndexedDB for storing simulations and profiles
- **Sync Mechanism**: Background synchronization when connectivity is restored
- **Offline Processing**: Limited local analysis capabilities when offline

## Data Flow

1. **Simulation Initiation**:
   - User selects or is presented with a simulation
   - Chamber loads narrative template from Library
   - Chamber renders initial scenario to user

2. **User Interaction**:
   - User provides natural language responses
   - Chamber processes responses and updates narrative state
   - Responses are stored in temporary session storage

3. **Simulation Completion**:
   - User calls "End Simulation" or reaches conclusion
   - All response data is sent to Profiler Engine
   - Profiler Engine generates comprehensive analysis

4. **Profile Update**:
   - Analysis results update user's psychological profile
   - Updated profile is stored in Library
   - Construct visualizes new profile data

5. **Historical Access**:
   - User can access past simulations from Library
   - Library provides filtering and search capabilities
   - Construct shows evolution of profile over time

## Security Considerations

- **Data Encryption**: All user data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Privacy Controls**: User control over data storage and sharing
- **Anonymization**: Option for anonymized profiles
- **Local Processing**: Option for on-device processing without cloud storage

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Load simulation content progressively
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed simulations and profile data
- **Compression**: Compress text data for efficient storage
- **Background Processing**: Perform heavy analysis in background threads
