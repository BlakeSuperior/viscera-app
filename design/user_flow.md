# VISCERA Mobile App User Flow

## Overview
This document outlines the user journey through the VISCERA application, mapping key interactions and navigation paths. The flow is designed to create an immersive, psychologically engaging experience while maintaining intuitive navigation.

## User Journey Map

### 1. Onboarding Experience
1. **Initial Launch**
   - App opens with atmospheric animation (smoke, gold ink effects)
   - VISCERA logo materializes with subtle audio (faint static, heartbeat)
   - Brief introduction to the concept appears as typed text

2. **Profile Creation**
   - User creates profile (optional anonymized mode available)
   - Initial psychological baseline questions presented
   - Brief tutorial on Chamber mechanics offered

3. **Consent Protocol**
   - Clear explanation of data usage and psychological nature
   - Privacy settings configuration
   - Confirmation of understanding before proceeding

### 2. Main Navigation

1. **Hub Interface**
   - Central navigation point styled as a dark cathedral space
   - Four primary pathways clearly indicated:
     - The Chamber (New Simulation)
     - The Library (Past Simulations)
     - The Construct (Profile Visualization)
     - Settings

2. **Navigation Principles**
   - Minimal UI elements during active simulation
   - Gesture-based navigation for immersion (swipe transitions)
   - Haptic feedback for significant interactions
   - Audio cues for system transitions

### 3. The Chamber Experience

1. **Simulation Selection**
   - Curated selection of available simulations
   - Categorized by psychological domains and complexity
   - Brief non-spoiler descriptions

2. **Simulation Initiation**
   - Transition effect into full-screen immersive mode
   - Title and simulation number displayed
   - Atmospheric setup text appears with cinematic pacing
   - Initial prompt presented

3. **Interaction Loop**
   - User provides natural language response
   - System processes and advances narrative
   - New scenario elements introduced
   - Loop continues until conclusion or user ends simulation

4. **Simulation Conclusion**
   - User types "End Simulation" or reaches natural endpoint
   - Transition effect to analysis mode
   - Loading sequence while profile analysis occurs

### 4. Analysis Experience

1. **Results Presentation**
   - Analysis displayed as classified report
   - Segmented into defined categories:
     - Summary of Decisions
     - Narrative Reflex Observed
     - Latent Traits Detected
     - Contradictions or Avoidance Patterns
     - Instruments of the Test
     - Reflection

2. **Post-Analysis Options**
   - Save analysis to Library
   - Add personal notes/annotations
   - View impact on Construct (profile)
   - Share insights (if enabled)
   - Return to Hub or start new simulation

### 5. The Library Experience

1. **Archive Navigation**
   - Chronological view (default)
   - Filter options:
     - By date
     - By tag/theme
     - By psychological outcome
     - By contradiction patterns

2. **Simulation Record View**
   - Complete transcript
   - Full analysis
   - Personal annotations
   - Trait updates highlighted
   - Option to replay simulation

### 6. The Construct Experience

1. **Profile Visualization**
   - Initial loading animation of profile construction
   - Primary view options:
     - Radar charts of trait clusters
     - Trait bars showing specific attributes
     - Contradiction heatmap
     - Narrative shift timeline

2. **Interaction Options**
   - Zoom/focus on specific traits
   - Compare time periods
   - View related simulations
   - Export insights (if enabled)

### 7. Settings & Customization

1. **Preference Controls**
   - Audio settings
   - Text display options (speed, size)
   - Haptic feedback intensity
   - Dark mode variations

2. **Privacy Controls**
   - Data storage options
   - Profile sharing settings
   - Export/delete data
   - Anonymization level

3. **Account Management**
   - Profile information
   - Subscription status (if applicable)
   - Backup/restore options

## Transition States

### Loading Transitions
- Chamber entry: Smoke effect with fading text
- Analysis generation: Medical/clinical scanning visuals
- Construct rendering: Data visualization assembly animation

### Error States
- Connection issues: Degraded experience messaging
- Processing failures: Retry options with atmospheric messaging
- Incomplete simulations: Recovery options

## Accessibility Considerations

- Text size adjustments
- High contrast mode option
- Alternative to haptic feedback
- Screen reader compatibility
- Reduced motion setting

## Performance Triggers

- Background loading of likely next content
- Preemptive analysis of partial responses
- Cached visualization data
- Progressive text rendering
