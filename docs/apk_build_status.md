# VISCERA Mobile App - APK Build Status

## Current Status
I've set up the Android project structure for the VISCERA mobile application with all the necessary configuration files. However, generating a complete APK requires additional steps that would be challenging to complete in this environment.

## What's Been Done
- Created complete Android project structure
- Set up all Gradle build scripts
- Configured AndroidManifest.xml
- Created Java entry point files (MainActivity and MainApplication)
- Added resource files (strings.xml, styles.xml)
- Prepared directory structure for app icons and assets

## Next Steps for APK Generation
To generate a complete APK, the following would be required:
1. Install Android SDK and build tools
2. Configure React Native dependencies properly
3. Generate app icons for all resolutions
4. Create a keystore for app signing
5. Run the Gradle build process

## Recommendation
For a production-ready APK, I recommend:
1. Clone the provided source code to a development environment with React Native and Android SDK installed
2. Follow the installation instructions in the documentation
3. Use the standard React Native build process to generate the APK

## Alternative Options
If you need a quick prototype APK, consider using Expo's build service which can generate APKs from React Native projects with minimal configuration.

I've provided all the source code and configuration needed to build the APK in a proper React Native development environment.
